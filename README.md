Titanic Dataset Analysis
Overview
This project involves the analysis of the Titanic dataset, which contains data about the passengers who were on board the Titanic. The goal of this analysis is to explore the data, understand the relationships between various features, and predict whether a passenger survived or not based on the available information.

Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis is the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. It consists of the following files:

train.csv: The training set containing labeled data, including survival outcomes.
test.csv: The test set containing unlabeled data, used to evaluate the model's performance.
Features
The dataset includes the following features:

PassengerId: Unique ID for each passenger
Survived: Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes) [Only in the training set]
Pclass: Ticket class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)
Name: Passenger's name
Sex: Passenger's sex
Age: Passenger's age
SibSp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard the Titanic
Parch: Number of parents/children aboard the Titanic
Ticket: Ticket number
Fare: Passenger fare
Cabin: Cabin number
Embarked: Port of Embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)
Analysis
Objectives
Data Exploration: Understand the distribution of variables and relationships between features.
Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistent data entries.
Feature Engineering: Create new features that may improve model performance.
Modeling: Build machine learning models to predict passenger survival.
Evaluation: Assess the performance of the models using various metrics.
Steps Taken
Data Exploration

Visualized distributions of features like age, fare, and class.
Analyzed correlations between features and survival.
Data Cleaning

Imputed missing values for age, embarked, and cabin.
Converted categorical variables (e.g., Sex, Embarked) into numerical form.
Feature Engineering

Created new features such as FamilySize (SibSp + Parch) and IsAlone (indicating if a passenger was alone).
Extracted titles from names to use as a feature.
Modeling

Tried various models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
Tuned hyperparameters using Grid Search and Cross-Validation.
Evaluation

Evaluated models using accuracy, precision, recall, and the AUC-ROC curve.
Selected the best-performing model for predictions on the test set.
Results
The best model achieved an accuracy of X.XX% on the validation set.
The most important features contributing to the survival prediction were Feature1, Feature2, and Feature3.
Conclusion
The analysis provided insights into the factors affecting survival on the Titanic. The final model demonstrated a solid ability to predict survival based on the available features, with Feature1 and Feature2 being the most significant predictors.
